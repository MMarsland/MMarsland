- 👋 Hi, I'm Michael Marsland! I am a graduate of Carleton University with a Bachelors of Engineering (Computer Systems) specializing in Robotics.
- 👀 I’m am currently looking for connections that will lead to opportunities that inspire my love for robotics and innovation, and will help make the world a better place to live in!
- 🌱 I’m currently working on a few projects expanding my skill sets in Python, Web Development, Raspberry Pi hardware interfacing, and Arduino Microcontrollers, as well as some Android Game development because I like to entertain myself.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any positions or projects you may have. I love to work in small teams and have a direct impact while also learning personally from more experienced engineers and allowing my individual skillset to be an asset.
- 📫 Please feel free to reach out to me via email at mmarsland@mac.com with any collaboration ideas, career prospects, or simply just to expand our networks.

Aside from reading some of the READMEs of my various projects here on Github you learn more about me on my [Website](https://mmarsland.com) or check out my most recent project, My Movember Campaign, Save-Or-Shave, for which I designed, built, and have hosted at [Save-Or-Shave](https://mmarsland.com/saveorshave/m/mmarsland). This year we raised over $1000 dollars for the Movember Campaign.

All the best and happy coding,

Cheers,  
Michael Marsland

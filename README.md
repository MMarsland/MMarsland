- 👋 Hi, I'm Michael Marsland! I've recently graduated from Carleton University with a Bachelors of Engineering (Computer Systems) specializing in Robotics.
- 👀 I’m am currently looking for a full-time robotics or IoT related position in California both for the nicer weather and the carreer opportunities.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on a few projects expanding my skill sets in Python, Web Development, Raspberry Pi hardware interfacing, and Arduino Microcontrollers, as well as some Android Game development because I like to entertain myself.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any positions or projects you may have. I love to work in small teams and have a direct impact while also learning personally from more experienced engineers and allowing my individual skillset to be an asset.
- 📫 Please feel free to reach out to me via email at mmarsland@mac.com with any collaboration ideas, career prospects, or simply just to expand our networks.

Aside from reading some of the READMEs of my various projects here on Github you can experience a Portfolio of some of my Web Development Projects hosted here on Github Pages @ [Portfolio](https://mmarsland.github.io/Portfolio/)

Also check out my most recent project, My Movember Campaign, Save-Or-Shave, for which I designed, built, and hosted this website on Google App Engine: [Save-Or-Shave](https://save-or-shave-v2.uw.r.appspot.com/m/mmarsland)

All the best and happy coding,

Cheers,  
Michael Marsland
